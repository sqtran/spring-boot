## Springboot HelloWorld App

Super simple spring-boot app for testing.

You can run it with the following command.

```bash
 mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once started, the root context `/` will return a "hello world" message.

You can access `/health` to view "**status.:.UP**" if the service is up and running.
